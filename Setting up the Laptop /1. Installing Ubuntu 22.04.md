# Installation of Ubuntu 22.04

### Prerequisites
- Computer with 64-Bit Processor.
- USB Flash Drive (Minimum Storage of 8 GB).
- You need to reserve a free space of minimum 50 GB for Ubuntu.
- You need a computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux to create a bootable disk with Ubuntu 22.04.


**_Important!_**
Make sure to back up whatever you have on the `computer` and the `flash drive`. This process will wipe the computer and the flash drive and any loss of data is irreversible.

## 2. Creating a Bootable Disk

Download the Balena Etcher application [here](https://etcher.balena.io) and open the application. You should be seeing something similar to this:

Finally, click on the `Flash!` button. This may take a few minutes to complete. Once complete, you can safely eject the drive from your computer and you have your bootable disk ready. 

**_Important!_**
Ignore any popups that you see such as a message saying `You need to format the disk before you can use it.`.
