# Installation of Ubuntu 22.04

### Prerequisites
- Computer with 64-Bit Processor.
- USB Flash Drive (Minimum Storage of 8 GB).
- You need to reserve a free space of minimum 50 GB for Ubuntu.
- You need a computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux to create a bootable disk with Ubuntu 22.04.


**_Important!_**
Make sure to back up whatever you have on the `computer` and the `flash drive`. This process will wipe the computer and the flash drive and any loss of data is irreversible.
