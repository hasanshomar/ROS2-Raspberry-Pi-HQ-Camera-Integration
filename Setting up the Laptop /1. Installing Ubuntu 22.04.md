# Installation of Ubuntu 22.04

### Prerequisites
- Computer with 64-Bit Processor.
- USB Flash Drive (Minimum Storage of 8 GB).
- You need to reserve a free space of minimum 50 GB for Ubuntu.
- You need a computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux to create a bootable disk with Ubuntu 22.04.


**_Important!_**
Make sure to back up whatever you have on the `computer` and the `flash drive`. This process will wipe the computer and the flash drive and any loss of data is irreversible.

## 1. Downloading the ISO Image

Go to [this website](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/?_gl=1*c5v0jr*_gcl_au*ODk2OTU2ODIxLjE3MzU1NTA1NjQ.&_ga=2.37136416.1248724141.1735550563-19461365.1734768458) and install the `64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image`.

## 2. Creating a Bootable Disk

Download the Balena Etcher application [here](https://etcher.balena.io) and open the application. You should be seeing something similar to this:

Click on `Flash from Drive` and select the .iso file that you downloaded in Step 1 (ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso). 

Insert your Flash Drive into your computer, click on `Select Target` and select it.

Finally, click on the `Flash!` button. This may take a few minutes to complete. Once complete, you can safely eject the drive from your computer and you have your bootable disk ready. 

**_Important!_**
Ignore any popups that you see such as a message saying `You need to format the disk before you can use it.`. 

## 3. Booting Ubuntu 22.04 onto your computer

For this example a Lenovo Legion Laptop is used. 
    1. Shut down the computer. 
    2. Insert the Flash Drive into your Computer. 
    3. Power on the Computer. While Powering on, make sure to repeatedly press the `F12` key to open the Boot Menu. You should see the following (or similar based on the name of your disk):

    4. Proceed with selecting `Try or Install Ubuntu`. Keep in mind, some computers have a timeout for the GRUB menu and so whatever option you are on will be the one chosen after a few seconds of being on this page. This will begin booting Ubuntu. 
    5. Once you see the `Welcome` Page, go ahead and select `Install Ubuntu`. 

### Setup Steps: 
1. Select your Language and click on `Continue`.
2. Select your Keyboard layout and click on `Continue`.
3. Connect to the Internet and click on `Continue`. You will need to connect to the Internet to continue the complete Installation of Ubuntu. If you are connected via Ethernet cable, you will not need to connect to a Wi-Fi network. 
4. On the next page you should see the following under `Updates and other software`. Chose the `Normal Installation`. Also select the option to `Download Updates while installing Ubuntu`.

5. On the next page `Installation type` select the option to `Erase disk and install Ubuntu`. This will assure that all other disk space on your computer is deleted and Ubuntu is installed onto an empty disk. Click on `Install Now`.
   The Installer will give you a summary of exactly what changes will be made:

   Click on `Continue`.
6. Select your region by clicking on your location on the map and click on `Continue`. If you are connected to the Internet, this should automatically place a pin at your current location.
7. On the next page you will input your name, your computer's name, and all other requested information. Click on `Continue` once done.

**With this you should have sucessfully installed Ubuntu 22.04!**
