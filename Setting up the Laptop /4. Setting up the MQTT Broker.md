# Setting up the MQTT Broker
---

### **Overview**
1. **Capture Images on the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera** at fixed intervals.
2. **Send the Captured Images** in real-time to the ROS 2 system on your Ubuntu 22 laptop.
3. Use a lightweight protocol (like MQTT or custom TCP/UDP) to transfer the images without requiring ROS 2 to run on the Raspberry Pi.


### **Stream Images Using MQTT**
**Why MQTT?**
- Lightweight and fast for real-time communication.
- Allows decoupling of the camera source from the ROS 2 system.
- Easy to set up and maintain.


#### **Step 1: Install MQTT Broker on Your Ubuntu Laptop**
The MQTT broker will act as the hub for communication between the Raspberry Pi and your laptop.

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu 22 laptop and run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   ```

2. Start the Mosquitto service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mosquitto
   sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
   ```

3. Test the broker (optional):
   - Open one terminal and run:
     ```bash
     mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test
     ```
   - Open another terminal and run:
     ```bash
     mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "Hello MQTT"
     ```
   - You should see "Hello MQTT" in the subscriber terminal.

If this does not work, check the status of the MQTT broker. Run the following command: 
```bash
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```

You should see a line that says: Active: active (running). If you don't see this, go ahead and run `sudo systemctl start mosquitto` again and check again. 

4. Ensure Mosquitto is Listening on Port 1883:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo ss -tuln | grep 1883
     ```
     You should see the following output:
     ```bash
     tcp   LISTEN 0      128    0.0.0.0:1883      0.0.0.0:*
     ```
     This checks whether Mosquitto is listening for connections on port 1883. If you see the above output, it means that Mosquitto is properly listening on port 1883.
   - If you don't see this output, but rather see something like:
     ```bash
     tcp   LISTEN 0      100        127.0.0.1:1883       0.0.0.0:*          
     tcp   LISTEN 0      100            [::1]:1883          [::]:*
     ```
     then proceed with the Step 2

---

### **Step 2: Update Mosquitto Configuration**
1. **Edit the Mosquitto Configuration File**:
   Open the configuration file on your laptop:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
   ```

2. **Add the Following Lines** at the end of the file:
   ```
   listener 1883
   allow_anonymous true
   ```

   - The `listener 1883` line tells Mosquitto to listen for connections on all network interfaces.
   - The `allow_anonymous true` line allows clients to connect without authentication (you can add authentication later if needed).

3. **Save and Exit**:
   - Press `Ctrl + O` to save.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit.

4. **Restart Mosquitto**:
   Restart the Mosquitto service to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Verify Mosquitto is Listening on All Interfaces**
Run the following command again to confirm:
```bash
sudo ss -tuln | grep 1883
```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  tcp   LISTEN 0      128    0.0.0.0:1883      0.0.0.0:*
  tcp   LISTEN 0      128       [::]:1883         [::]:*
  ```
  If this is the output, Mosquitto is now ready to accept connections from external devices.


With this, you have successfully setup your Lapto to start receiving images from the Raspberry Pi.
