# Creating Image Publisher Node 
---

### **Step 1: Create the Image Processing Node Script**

1. **Navigate to Your Package Directory**:
   - Move into the package directory where you'll create the script:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src/system/system
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script**:
   - Inside the `system` directory, create a new directory called `scripts` if it doesnâ€™t exist, and then create a Python script named `publisher.py`:

   ```bash
   mkdir scripts
   cd scripts
   touch publisher.py
   ```

3. **Write the Image Publishing Script**:
   - Open the `publisher.py` file with your preferred text editor:

   ```bash
   gedit image_publisher.py
   ```

   **_*Note_**: If gedit is not installed, install it by running `sudo apt install gedit`.
   
   - Add the following code to the script:

   ```python
   # PUBLISHER NODE

   import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
   from cv_bridge import CvBridge
   from datetime import datetime
   import numpy as np
   import cv2

   BROKER_ADDRESS = "localhost"
   MQTT_TOPIC = "camera/images"
   ROS_TOPIC = "image_topic"

class MqttToRosPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('mqtt_to_ros_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(Image, ROS_TOPIC, 10)
        self.bridge = CvBridge()

        self.mqtt_client = mqtt.Client()
        self.mqtt_client.on_message = self.on_message
        self.mqtt_client.connect(BROKER_ADDRESS, 1883, 60)
        self.mqtt_client.subscribe(MQTT_TOPIC)
        self.mqtt_client.loop_start()
        self.get_logger().info(f"Subscribed to MQTT topic: {MQTT_TOPIC}")


    def on_message(self, client, userdata, msg):
        self.get_logger().info(f"Image received from MQTT topic: {MQTT_TOPIC}")

        image_data = msg.payload
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

        try:
            np_arr = np.frombuffer(image_data, np.uint8)
            cv_image = cv2.imdecode(np_arr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

            ros_image = self.bridge.cv2_to_imgmsg(cv_image, encoding="bgr8")
            ros_image.header.frame_id = f"mqtt_image_{timestamp}"

            self.publisher_.publish(ros_image)
            self.get_logger().info(f"Published image to ROS topic: {ROS_TOPIC}")

        except Exception as e:
            self.get_logger().error(f"Failed to process or publish image: {e}")

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    mqtt_to_ros_publisher = MqttToRosPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(mqtt_to_ros_publisher)
    mqtt_to_ros_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

   ```

   - Make sure to replace `'/path/to/your/image_directory'` with the actual path to your directory containing the images.

5. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - After saving the file, make it executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x image_publisher.py
   ```

### **Step 2: Update Package Files**

1. **Update `setup.py`**:
   - Open the `setup.py` file in the root of your package:
  
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test
   gedit setup.py
   ```

   - Modify the `entry_points` section to include the new script:

   ```python
   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'image_publisher = image_processor_test.scripts.image_publisher:main',
       ],
   },
   ```
   - Also modify the `packages` field to the following:
   ```bash
   packages=[package_name, package_name + '.scripts'],
   ```

2. **Rebuild the Workspace**:
   - Navigate back to the workspace root and rebuild:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test
   colcon build
   ```
   **If you get a warning message** like the following:
   ```bash
   Starting >>> image_processor_test
   --- stderr: image_processor_test                   
   package init file 'image_processor_test/scripts/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)
   ---
   Finished <<< image_processor_test [0.54s]

   Summary: 1 package finished [0.69s]
   1 package had stderr output: image_processor_test
   ```
   then run the following few commands to add the `__init__.py` file into the scripts folder:
   ```bash
   touch ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test/image_processor_test/scripts/__init__.py
   ```
  This should resolve the issue and you can run the `colcon build` command once more to complete the build of the package.
  
4. **Source the Workspace**:
   - Source the setup file to make sure the new script is available:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

### **Step 3: Run the Node**

1. **Run the Image Publisher Node**:
   - Now, you can run the node to start publishing images from the directory:

   ```bash
   ros2 run image_processor_test image_publisher
   ```

   - You should see the node publishing images at the specified interval.

- **Viewing the Images**:
  - If you want to visualize the images being published, you could use a tool like `rqt_image_view`, which can subscribe to the image topic and display the images in real-time.

Open a new terminal tab and run the following:
    ```
    ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
    ```
Select the topic your images are being published on (`/image_topic`, for example) to see the images.
