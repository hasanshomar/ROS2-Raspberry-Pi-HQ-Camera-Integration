# Installing Additional Dependencies

This project requires several Python libraries to enable MQTT communication, image processing, and TensorFlow-based machine learning. Below is a list of all required dependencies with their purposes, installation commands, and version-checking commands.

---

### **Dependencies**

#### Required Versions: 
- `paho-mqtt`: 2.1.0
- `cv2`: 4.10.0
- `numpy`: 1.24.0
- `tensorflow`: 2.17.0

1. **`paho-mqtt`**:
   - **Purpose**: Enables MQTT communication between the Raspberry Pi and the laptop.
   - **Installation Command**:
     ```bash
     pip install "paho-mqtt==2.1.0"
     ```
   - **Version Check**:
     ```bash
     pip show paho-mqtt
     ```

2. **`opencv-python-headless`**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides OpenCV functionality for image preprocessing and handling without GUI components.
   - **Installation Command**:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python-headless
     ```
   - **Version Check**:
     ```bash
     python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
     ```

3. **`numpy`**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles numerical operations and data manipulation for image and array processing.
   - **Installation Command**:
     ```bash
     pip install "numpy==1.24.0"
     ```
   - **Version Check**:
     ```bash
     python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
     ```

4. **`tensorflow`**:
   - **Purpose**: Runs the ML segmentation model to analyze images and measure layer heights.
   - **Installation Command**:
     ```bash
     pip install "tensorflow==2.17.0"
     ```
   - **Version Check**:
     ```bash
     python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
     ```

5. **`rclpy`**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides ROS 2 Python client library for creating ROS nodes.
   - **Installation Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install ros-humble-rclpy
     ```
   - **Version Check**:
     ```bash
     ros2 pkg list | grep rclpy
     ```

6. **`cv_bridge`**:
   - **Purpose**: Converts ROS image messages to OpenCV format and vice versa.
   - **Installation Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install ros-humble-cv-bridge
     ```
   - **Version Check**:
     ```bash
     ros2 pkg list | grep cv-bridge
     ```

### **Additional Notes**
- **Verify Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3.10 (required by ROS 2 Humble). Check with:
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
- **Check ROS 2 Installation**: Ensure ROS 2 is properly installed and sourced:
  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
  ```

#### Lastly, a few more things: 

When running Python script later on you might see some warning messages when using tensorflow. To get rid of these or fix the warnings, run the following:
The messages about CUDA drivers indicate that TensorFlow is attempting to use GPU acceleration but cannot find compatible CUDA drivers or a GPU. If you are running on a system without a GPU or without the necessary CUDA drivers, you can safely configure TensorFlow to use only the CPU.
   1. Set an environment variable to disable GPU usage:
      ```bash
      export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1
      export TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0
      ```
   2. To make this permanent, add the line above to your `~/.bashrc` file and reload it:
      ```bash
      echo 'export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1' >> ~/.bashrc
      echo 'export TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0' >> ~/.bashrc
      ```
   3. Reload your `~/.bashrc` file:
      ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

Also, the `TensorRT` warning is harmless and only appears because TensorFlow is searching for TensorRT libraries. If you are not using TensorRT, you can ignore this warning. To suppress all TensorFlow warnings, set the following environment variable:
   Run:
      ```bash
      export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2
      echo 'export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2' >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```
