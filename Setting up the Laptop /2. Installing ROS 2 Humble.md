# Installing ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04

For most updated Installation please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).
The following instructions were last used and verified on December 30, 2024.

1. Set Locale

Make sure you have a locale which supports `UTF-8`. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like `POSIX`. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```
