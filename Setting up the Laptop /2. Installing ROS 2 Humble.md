# Installing ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04

For most updated Installation please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).
The following instructions were last used and verified on December 30, 2024.

## 1. Set Locale

Make sure you have a locale which supports `UTF-8`. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like `POSIX`. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

## 2. Setup Sources

You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.

First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Then add the repository to your sources list.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

## 3. Install ROS 2 Packages

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories. ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is also up to date before installing new packages.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones): Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools. No GUI tools.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base
```

Development tools: Compilers and other tools to build ROS packages

```bash
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
```

## 4. Environment Setup 
### Sourcing the Setup Script 

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

```bash
# Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash
# Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

### Try Some Examples to verify the Installation

#### Talker-Listener 

If you installed `ros-humble-desktop` above you can try some examples.

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ `talker`:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python `listener`:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

You should see the `talker` saying that it’s `Publishing` messages and the `listener` saying `I heard` those messages. This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly. Hooray!
