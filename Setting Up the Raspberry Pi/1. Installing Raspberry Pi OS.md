# Installing Raspberry Pi OS

---

Similar to How done for installing Ubuntu 22.04 by creating a bootable disk, booting the Raspberry Pi OS also required a drive that you will you use for this application. However, as the Raspberry Pi 5 used in this project only takes Micro SD Cards as disks, you will require a Micro SD card with a minimum storage capacity of 32 GB. 

## 1. Creating the Bootable Drive 

Firstly, you will need to install the Raspberry Pi Imager Software which you can download from [this website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). 

Once downloaded you will click on `Choose Device` under `Raspberry Pi Device` and select the `Raspberry Pi 5`. 

Next, you will click on `Choose OS` under `Operating System` and select `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)`.

Finally, you will click on `Choose Storage` under `Storage` and select your Micro SD card.

Click on `Next` to create the bootable drive.

If you get a popup saying `Would you like to apply OS customisation settings?`, select `No` and proceed. 
You should also see a warning message saying `All existing data on `Your Drive` will be erased. Are you sure you want to continue?`. Select `Yes` and proceed. 

Once the Writing and Verification of the Drive is complete you can safely take out the SD card.
