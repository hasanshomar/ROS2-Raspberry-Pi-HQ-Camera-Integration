# **Enabling and Testing the Camera**

The following steps will guide you through enabling the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, verifying its functionality, and testing it with basic commands. This ensures that the camera is correctly connected and ready for further usage.

---

### **1. Enabling the Camera**

1. Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Run the following command to access the Raspberry Pi configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
3. Navigate to:
   - **Interfacing Options** > **Camera** > **Enable**.
4. Save the configuration and exit the menu.
5. Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

### **2. Verifying the Camera**

After the reboot, verify that the camera is recognized by the system:
1. Check connected cameras:
   ```bash
   libcamera-hello --list-cameras
   ```
   - You should see output listing the connected camera details (e.g., IMX477 for the HQ Camera).

2. Test the camera with a preview command:
   ```bash
   libcamera-hello
   ```
   - A live preview window should open for a few seconds. If it does, the camera is working properly.

### **3. Testing the Camera with Basic Commands**

Here are some useful `libcamera` commands to test the camera:

#### **Taking a Still Image**
1. Capture a single image and save it as `test_image.jpg`:
   ```bash
   libcamera-still -o test_image.jpg
   ```
2. Check if the image is saved and viewable:
   ```bash
   ls
   xdg-open test_image.jpg
   ```

#### **Recording a Video**
1. Record a 10-second video and save it as `test_video.h264`:
   ```bash
   libcamera-vid -o test_video.h264 --timeout 10000
   ```
2. Convert the video to a viewable format (optional):
   ```bash
   MP4Box -add test_video.h264 test_video.mp4
   ```
3. Play the video:
   ```bash
   xdg-open test_video.mp4
   ```

### **4. Adjusting the Lens Focus**

To adjust the camera lens focus, run the camera in a continuous stream mode:

1. Start a continuous video stream:
   ```bash
   libcamera-vid -t 0
   ```
   - The `-t 0` flag ensures the stream runs indefinitely.

2. Observe the live stream on the connected monitor.
3. Adjust the focus ring on the camera lens until the image is sharp.

4. Exit the stream by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
- If the camera is not detected:
  1. Check that the ribbon cable is securely connected to both the camera and the Raspberry Pi.
  2. Ensure that the camera module is enabled in the Raspberry Pi configuration (`sudo raspi-config`).
  3. Verify that the software is up to date:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

- If the preview or commands fail:
  - Reboot the Raspberry Pi and repeat the steps.
