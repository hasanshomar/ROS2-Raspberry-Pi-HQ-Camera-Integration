# **Installing Python Libraries**

To enable image capturing and transmission functionalities on your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install several Python libraries. These libraries facilitate camera interaction, image processing, and MQTT communication.

### **1. Update and Upgrade the System**

Before installing new packages, ensure your system is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### **2. Install Python 3 and pip**

Verify that Python 3 and `pip` (Python package installer) are installed:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If they are not installed, you can install them using:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

### **3. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies:

1. **Install `venv` module** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-venv -y
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** named `mqtt_env` in your home directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   python3 -m venv mqtt_env
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   source mqtt_env/bin/activate
   ```

   After activation, your command prompt should display `(mqtt_env)` indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### **4. Install Required Python Libraries**

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

- **`paho-mqtt`**: Enables MQTT communication between devices.

  ```bash
  pip install paho-mqtt
  ```

- **`opencv-python-headless`**: Provides OpenCV functionalities for image processing without GUI support.

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python-headless
  ```

- **`numpy`**: Supports numerical operations essential for image processing.

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

- **`picamera2`**: Facilitates interaction with the Raspberry Pi camera module.

  ```bash
  pip install picamera2
  ```

### **5. Verify the Installation**

After installation, verify that the libraries are correctly installed by checking their versions:

- **`paho-mqtt`**:

  ```bash
  python -c "import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt; print(mqtt.__version__)"
  ```

- **`opencv-python-headless`**:

  ```bash
  python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
  ```

- **`numpy`**:

  ```bash
  python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
  ```

- **`picamera2`**:

  ```bash
  python -c "import picamera2; print(picamera2.__version__)"
  ```

If the versions are displayed without errors, the installations are successful.

### **6. Additional Configuration for `picamera2`**

The `picamera2` library may require additional system packages. Install them using:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-prctl libatlas-base-dev ffmpeg libopenjp2-7
```

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running the latest firmware:

```bash
sudo rpi-update
```

Reboot the system to apply changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### **7. Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

Once you've finished installing the necessary libraries, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

To reactivate the virtual environment in future sessions, navigate to your home directory and run:

```bash
source mqtt_env/bin/activate
```

---

By following these steps, your Raspberry Pi will be equipped with the necessary Python libraries within a virtual environment to capture images and transmit them via MQTT. This setup ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated and managed effectively.
