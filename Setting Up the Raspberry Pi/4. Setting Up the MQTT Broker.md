# Setting up the MQTT Broker
---

### **Stream Images Using MQTT**
**Why MQTT?**
- Lightweight and fast for real-time communication.
- Allows decoupling of the camera source from the ROS 2 system.
- Easy to set up and maintain.

---

#### **Step 1: Install MQTT Broker on the Raspberry Pi**
The MQTT broker will act as the hub for communication between the Raspberry Pi and your laptop.

1. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   ```

2. Start the Mosquitto service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mosquitto
   sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
   ```

3. Test the broker (optional):
   - Open one terminal and run:
     ```bash
     mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test
     ```
   - Open another terminal and run:
     ```bash
     mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "Hello MQTT"
     ```
   - You should see "Hello MQTT" in the subscriber terminal.

If this does not work, check the status of the MQTT broker. Run the following command: 
```bash
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```

You should see a line that says: Active: active (running). If you don't see this, go ahead and run `sudo systemctl start mosquitto` again and check again. 

4. Ensure Mosquitto is Listening on Port 1883:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo ss -tuln | grep 1883
     ```
     You should see the following output:
     ```bash
     tcp   LISTEN 0      128    0.0.0.0:1883      0.0.0.0:*
     ```
     This checks whether Mosquitto is listening for connections on port 1883. If you see the above output, it means that Mosquitto is properly listening on port 1883.

---

#### **Step 2: Update Mosquitto Configuration**

Most probably you will not see the above output so you'll need to make the following adjustments similar to how done on the Laptop before. 

1. **Edit the Mosquitto Configuration File**:
   Open the configuration file on your laptop:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
   ```

2. **Add the Following Lines** at the end of the file:
   ```
   listener 1883
   allow_anonymous true
   ```

   - The `listener 1883` line tells Mosquitto to listen for connections on all network interfaces.
   - The `allow_anonymous true` line allows clients to connect without authentication (you can add authentication later if needed).

3. **Save and Exit**:
   - Press `Ctrl + O` to save.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit.

4. **Restart Mosquitto**:
   Restart the Mosquitto service to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
   ```

---

#### **Step 3: Verify Mosquitto is Listening on All Interfaces**
Run the following command again to confirm:
```bash
sudo ss -tuln | grep 1883
```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  tcp   LISTEN 0      128    0.0.0.0:1883      0.0.0.0:*
  tcp   LISTEN 0      128       [::]:1883         [::]:*
  ```
  If this is the output, Mosquitto is now ready to accept connections from external devices.


With this, you have successfully setup your Raspberry Pi to start sending images to the Laptop.

#### Step 4: Testing MQTT Connection between the Laptop and the Raspberry Pi



1. **On Your Laptop**:
   - Open a terminal and use the following command to get your Device's IP address:
     ```bash
     hostname -I
     ```
     
   - Open another terminal tab and subscribe to the `test` topic:
     ```bash
     mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test
     ```

2. **On Your Raspberry Pi**:
   - Publish a test message to the `test` topic:
     ```bash
     mosquitto_pub -h <your-laptop-ip> -t test -m "Hello from Raspberry Pi"
     ```
     Replace `<your-laptop-ip>` with the IP address of your laptop (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).


##### **Expected Outcome**
- The laptop terminal (running `mosquitto_sub`) should display:
  ```
  Hello from Raspberry Pi
  ```

With this you should have everything ready to begin taking images on the Raspberry Pi and sending them to the laptop to process them.
