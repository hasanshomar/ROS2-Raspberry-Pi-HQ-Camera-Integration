# **Creating and Using the Python Script for Image Capture and Transmission**

The following steps will guide you through creating and running a Python script to capture images using the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera and send them to the laptop over MQTT.

---

### **1. Creating the Python Script**

1. Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Navigate to your preferred working directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```
3. Create a new Python file named `image_sender.py`:
   ```bash
   nano image_sender.py
   ```

4. Copy and paste the following script into the file:

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import subprocess
import time
import os
import cv2 
import numpy as np

def start_live_feed():
    subprocess.Popen(["libcamera-vid", "-t", "0", "--inline"], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)

def capture_snapshot(filename="snapshot.jpg"):
    subprocess.run(["libcamera-still", "-o", filename, "--width", "1920", "--height", "1080"], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)

def resize_image(filename, target_size=(480, 360)):
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        image = cv2.imread(filename)
        if image is not None:
            resized_image = cv2.resize(image, target_size)
            cv2.imwrite(filename, resized_image)
        else:
            print(f"Error: Could not read the image {filename}.")

def send_image(client, topic, filename="snapshot.jpg"):
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        with open(filename, "rb") as image_file:
            image_data = image_file.read()
            client.publish(topic, image_data)


def main():
    broker_address = "192.168.66.132"
    topic = "camera/images"

    client = mqtt.Client()
    client.connect(broker_address, 1883, 60)

    start_live_feed()
    print("Live camera feed started.")

    while True:
        capture_snapshot("snapshot.jpg")
        resize_image("snapshot.jpg")
        send_image(client, topic, "snapshot.jpg")
        print("Resized snapshot sent!")
        time.sleep(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Finally, use `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and `Ctrl+X` so save and close the text editor.

### **2. Installing Required Libraries**

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed on the Raspberry Pi:

- **`paho-mqtt`**: For MQTT communication.
- **`opencv-python-headless`**: For capturing and resizing images.
- **`numpy`**: For image processing.

You can install them using:
```bash
pip3 install paho-mqtt opencv-python-headless numpy
```

---

### **3. Running the Python Script**

1. Ensure the MQTT broker on the laptop is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mosquitto
   ```

2. Run the Python script on the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   python3 image_sender.py
   ```

3. Check the logs:
   - The script will log messages like:
     ```
     Image sent at 2023-12-28 15:30:45
     ```

---

### **4. Verifying Image Transmission**

On the laptop:
1. Subscribe to the MQTT topic to verify image transmission:
   ```bash
   mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t camera/images > received_image.jpg
   ```
2. Open the received image:
   ```bash
   xdg-open received_image.jpg
   ```

By following these steps, your Raspberry Pi will continuously capture and transmit images to the laptop, enabling seamless integration with your data collection system.
