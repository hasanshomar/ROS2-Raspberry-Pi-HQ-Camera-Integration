# Setting up Raspberry Pi OS

---

## 1. Installing Raspberry Pi OS

Similar to How done for installing Ubuntu 22.04 by creating a bootable disk, booting the Raspberry Pi OS also required a drive that you will you use for this application. However, as the Raspberry Pi 5 used in this project only takes Micro SD Cards as disks, you will require a Micro SD card with a minimum storage capacity of 32 GB. 

- Firstly, you will need to install the Raspberry Pi Imager Software which you can download from [this website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). 
- Once downloaded you will click on `Choose Device` under `Raspberry Pi Device` and select the `Raspberry Pi 5`. 
- Next, you will click on `Choose OS` under `Operating System` and select `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)`.
- Finally, you will click on `Choose Storage` under `Storage` and select your Micro SD card.
- Click on `Next` to create the bootable drive.

_Note_: If you get a popup saying `Would you like to apply OS customisation settings?`, select `No` and proceed. 
You should also see a warning message saying `All existing data on `Your Drive` will be erased. Are you sure you want to continue?`. Select `Yes` and proceed. 

Once the Writing and Verification of the Drive is complete you can safely take out the SD card. 

## 2. Connecting Hardware

For this project, you will need the following equipment for the basic setup of the Raspberry Pi 5: 
- Raspberry Pi 5 Board  
- Official Raspberry Pi 27W USB-C Power Supply  
- MakerDisk 32GB MicroSD Card (bootable disk prepared earlier)
- A Monitor that takes HDMI Input
- HDMI Cable (to connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor)  
- USB Keyboard and Mouse
Also (used in later parts of this Documentation): 
- Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera (CS Mount)  
- Compatible CS Mount Lens  

### Steps to Connect the Hardware:
1. Insert the **MicroSD card** (prepared earlier) into the microSD slot of the Raspberry Pi 5.  
4. Connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor using the **HDMI cable**.  
5. Attach the **keyboard and mouse** to the USB ports on the Raspberry Pi.  
6. Plug in the **power supply** to the Raspberry Pi, but do not turn it on yet.

## 3. Initial Raspberry Pi Setup

1. **Power On**:  
   Plug in the power supply to the wall socket to boot the Raspberry Pi for the first time. You should see the Raspberry Pi OS setup screen on the connected monitor.

2. **Configure Settings**:  
   - Select your language, time zone, and keyboard layout.
   - Connect to a Wi-Fi network or use an Ethernet cable for a wired connection.

     ## IMPORTANT:
     To ensure that this project works as needed, it is essential that you connect the Raspberry Pi to the same network as your laptop!

   - Update the system when prompted.

3. **Enable the Camera**:
   - Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi and run:
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
   - Navigate to **Interfacing Options** > **Camera** > **Enable**.  
   - Reboot the Raspberry Pi when prompted.

4. **Install Updates and Dependencies**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following commands to update the system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - Install essential tools:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install git python3-pip -y
     ```
